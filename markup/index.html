We live in a typographic wonderland. Typographers have more typefaces to choose from than ever before, and computers make setting type easier than ever. The truth is, if you’re using a good typesetting application and you just leave the settings on default, you can set type that’s more or less adequate.
However, good typographers are experts who have something to add to the reading experience. They finely tune the typography for specific documents to make it more than just adequate. In their choice of typefaces and decisions about things like point size and spacing, typographers clarify the voice of the author and make the reading experience more enjoyable.

This isn’t meant to discourage beginners from attempting typography. But it is important to acknowledge that the art of typography is often subtle, and without training it can be difficult to see what’s going on. The goal of this book is to help students train their eyes to see text as typographers do.

The focus of this text is on the Latin alphabet (which is the alphabet used for English) and Latin typography. Of course, there are many other writing systems in use in our world. There are other alphabetic systems like Greek, Hebrew and Arabic. There are syllabic systems like Hangul, used for the Korean language. There are logographic systems like Chinese. The rules for Latin typography might not apply to these other writing systems.

This doesn’t mean that our typographic insights are limited to English. Variants of the Latin alphabet are used all around the world to write hundreds of different languages. These include Roman languages like French, Spanish and Italian; Germanic languages like English, Dutch and German; Celtic languages like Irish and Welsh; Slavic languages like Czech and Polish; and many others. Some of these languages use characters that are not used in English, like the Danish Ø or the German ß Or characters might be dropped, like the K in Italian. The Latin alphabet is a global phenomenon.

Even for languages within the same writing system, different rules may apply. In addition to the basic rules of Latin typography that they share, there are specific rules tuned to the peculiarities of a language’s grammar and appearance. The focus here is mostly limited to the common basics.

The book begins with general explanations of how type works and how we read. Then it steps through the different kinds of space in a paragraph. Finally, it puts everything together with a discussion about paragraph settings.

Typography started with paragraphs of printed text. Since then, it has evolved in all sorts of directions, sometimes leaving printing behind entirely. But the printed paragraph is still a good starting point. Understanding what goes on inside it is a solid foundation on which to add additional knowledge.

And that’s what this book is meant to be—a foundation. It’s the book I wanted when I was a student in my first typography course.
